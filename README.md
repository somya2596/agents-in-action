# Agents in Action

A companion repository for the **Agents in Action** Medium series.

This repo contains code, diagrams, and experiments from my learning journey:
- ✅ LLM fundamentals and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- ✅ Data pipelines and vector databases
- ✅ Multi-agent design with LangGraph
- ✅ Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) integrations

Each folder corresponds to a series installment, so you can follow along or try specific implementations.

No specific programming language is required to understand the concepts.
